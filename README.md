# image-to-ascii

This program converts images into ASCII art. This is done by splitting an image into a grid. Each grid tile is 
 assigned an ASCII character based on the average brightness of all the pixels in it.

The project took inspiration from chapter 6 of 'Python Playground - Geeky Projects for the Curious Programmer'by Mahesh Venkitachalam.
Its concepts on generating ASCII art from images has been transferred to Java with a GUI approach, rather than a CLI one.
